# News Ranking and Classifier System

## Overview

This project is a News Ranking and Classifier System designed to automate the process of fetching, preprocessing, classifying, and ranking news articles from the Dawn website. The system uses advanced NLP techniques including transformer models to identify similar news articles and categorize them into categories.

## Key Features

- **Web Scraping**: Automated fetching of news articles from the Dawn website.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing text data for analysis.
- **News Classification**: Categorizing news articles using a fine-tuned BERT model (`distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english`).
- **Similarity Detection**: Identifying similar news articles using transformer models.
- **Scheduled Execution**: Running tasks periodically to keep the data up-to-date.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyzing and visualizing the distribution of news categories.
